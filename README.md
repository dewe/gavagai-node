];

client.stories(texts, function(err, data) {
    if (err) {

    }

For each text, return their tonality based on lexical analysis in multiple dimensions.
This method accepts either an array of texts, or a single string as input.

All methods accepts options as a second paramter. Options are corresponding to API parameters.
E.g. if I have a set of french texts that I want to analyze:

```javascript
client.topics(texts, { language: 'fr' }, function(err, data) {
    if (err) {
       console.error('error:', err);
    }
    console.log('stories returned:', data);
});
```
